If you are writing to twitter so a Direct Message, Tweet, Retweet etc then you need to instantiate a twitter writer:

            // Set up for Twitter Auth
            var twitterWriter = new TwitterWriter
            {
                ConsumerKey = twitterAuth[0],
                ConsumerSharedSecret = twitterAuth[1],
                OAuthToken = twitterAuth[2],
                OAuthTokenSecret = twitterAuth[3]
            };

In the above, the ConsumerKey are those you obtained from going to apps.twitter.com and generating your keys.
Make sure you generate the right permissions. 

Next you can make your call on the twitter Writer as one of the following:

	// Publish a direct message. Note taht twitter handle is whom you are direct messaging as you have already authenticated as you.
	// Text is the text you want to publish.
	var result = twiterWriter.PublishMessage(TwitterHandle, Text);

The other writer methods work the same way.

If you are reading from twitter so list of followers, Tweet for a list, etc then you need to instantiate a twitter reader:

            // Set up for Twitter Auth
            var twitterReader = new TwitterReader
            {
                ConsumerKey = twitterAuth[0],
                ConsumerSharedSecret = twitterAuth[1],
                OAuthToken = twitterAuth[2],
                OAuthTokenSecret = twitterAuth[3]
            };

In the above, the ConsumerKey are those you obtained from going to apps.twitter.com and generating your keys.
Make sure you generate the right permissions. 

Next you can make your call on the twitter reader as one of the following:

		var messagesReceivedJson = twitterReader.GetLatestMessagesReceived();

In the case of a list you may need more information. So we use the listId to get the list and then get the tweets from people in that list.

            var list = twitterReader.GetList(Convert.ToInt64(activityDataRow["ListId"]));
            timelineJson = twitterReader.GetTweetsFromListAsJson(list);

There are many ways to get the list. If you dont have the listid you can use the listName and the screenName that owns the list.

        public ITwitterList GetList(string listName, string screenName)
